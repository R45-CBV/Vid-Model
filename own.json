        "question": "What is the significance of using precision and recall in medical diagnostics?",
        "answer": "In medical diagnostics, precision and recall are crucial metrics because they evaluate how well a model identifies positive cases (recall) and ensures that positive predictions are correct (precision)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the importance of using precision in fraud detection?",
        "answer": "In fraud detection, high precision is essential to ensure that detected fraudulent transactions are indeed fraudulent and that legitimate transactions are not falsely flagged."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is recall used in anomaly detection?",
        "answer": "In anomaly detection, recall is important because it ensures that the model identifies as many of the true anomalies as possible, minimizing the number of false negatives."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the impact of choosing the wrong threshold on precision and recall?",
        "answer": "Choosing the wrong threshold can lead to either a high number of false positives (lower precision) or false negatives (lower recall). Fine-tuning the threshold is important for optimizing both metrics."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why are precision and recall important in classification tasks with imbalanced datasets?",
        "answer": "Precision and recall are important in imbalanced datasets because accuracy alone can be misleading. They provide more insight into the model’s performance, especially in recognizing the minority class."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the choice of performance metric affect the model evaluation?",
        "answer": "The choice of performance metric depends on the specific problem and the costs associated with false positives and false negatives. For instance, precision may be more important in fraud detection, while recall may be critical in medical diagnosis."

      {
        "question": "How can a GRU-based model be used in NLP?",
        "answer": "Natural Language Processing, or NLP, is a branch of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there risks with AI?",
        "answer": "Currently, AI can mimic some aspects of human thinking, but it does not truly think or understand like humans do."

        "question": "What is Machine Learning?",
        "answer": "Machine Learning is a method of teaching computers to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the types of Machine Learning?",
        "answer": "There are three main types: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning."
      },
      {
        "question": "Explain supervised learning.",
        "answer": "Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the correct output is provided."
      },
      {
        "question": "Explain unsupervised learning.",
        "answer": "Unsupervised learning involves finding hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data without labeled responses."
      },
      {
        "question": "Tell me about reinforcement learning.",
        "answer": "Reinforcement learning is about training agents to make sequences of decisions by rewarding them for good actions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is Deep Learning?",
        "answer": "Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning based on neural networks with many layers."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is Artificial Intelligence?",
        "answer": "Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is the father of Artificial Intelligence?",
        "answer": "John McCarthy is known as the father of Artificial Intelligence."

        "question": "What is a dataset?",
        "answer": "A dataset is a collection of data that is used to train or test Machine Learning models."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is overfitting?",
        "answer": "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise, and performs poorly on new data."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is underfitting?",
        "answer": "Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a neural network?",
        "answer": "A neural network is a series of algorithms that attempt to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is an epoch in Machine Learning?",
        "answer": "An epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a learning rate?",
        "answer": "Learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls how much to change the model in response to the estimated error each time the model weights are updated."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is bias in Machine Learning?",
        "answer": "Bias is an error introduced by approximating a real-world problem, which may lead the model to miss relevant relations."

      {
        "question": "What is variance in Machine Learning?",
        "answer": "Variance is the amount that the model prediction would change if we estimated it using a different training dataset."
